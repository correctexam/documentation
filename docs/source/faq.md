It is required to give a name to a module. 


### Can I share a correction with one or more colleagues

When you click on the module, you will have access in the list of actions to a shared action that allows you to share this module with one or more colleagues. These colleagues will then see this module in the list of their modules.

### Can I limit the rights of a colleague so that he can only access a subset of the questions?

No, a colleague, we can trust him ;). We do not implement any specific RBAC rules per exam. 

### Do you have a diagram of the main steps to do to use this application ?

### How to create an exam ?

To create an exam, once you enter the page of a module, it is possible to create a new exam with the command carousel. 

### Where can I find some templates for Word latex and libreoffice ?

In the view that allows you to create an exam, you have access to a number of templates to create your exam. The philosophy of the application is to let each teacher create his exam with the tool he likes. 

### Why am I forced to upload a list of students?

To correct, we associate each answer key with a student. This list is required to do the assignment task.

### Do I have to delete a student who did not compose? 

No, it will be marked as ABI by default. 

### Can you explain the different types of questions that are available

For the moment, there are roughly four types of questions. 

- **MCQs** for which the application provides marking assistance. 
- The **DIRECT** scoring (*Manual and Direct*) for which the teacher manually scores the answers to this question. 
- **POSITIVE** scoring (*Manual and POSITIVE*). This remains an element for which the teacher can define a set of comments along the way that gives points to the answers for this question (we start from zero). The total number of points obtained cannot exceed the maximum number of points associated with this question.
- The **NEGATIVE** notation (*Manual and NEGATIVE*). This is an element for which the corrector can define a set of comments along the way that removes points from the answer in question (we start from the maximum number of points possible for this question). The total number of points obtained cannot go below zero.

These types of questions will be enriched in the future. Please provide your great idea. 

### Can I change the type of question when the correction of a question has started

Honestly, not recommended because not tested. 


### Can I host an instance of this application on my own infrastructure ?

Yes please go to the documentation for developers. We provide scripts to deploy this application on any type of infrastructure from a powerful server with K8S to a raspberry 4. 


### How do I scan students' sheets ?

We recommend using grayscale at 200 DPI to keep the file size reasonable but no problem with a color scan at 300 DPI if necessary. Avoid pure black and white which could be detrimental to the algo that recognizes names/first names/ids (INE) of students



### Can I compose a statement with another tool than word, excel or latex

Of course, the only important point is a circle marker in the corners to facilitate alignment and light gray squares to put the names, first names and ids (INE) of students. 
### What to do when I encounter a bug in the application

Use the github ticket system on the project https://github.com/correctexam/corrigeExamFront
